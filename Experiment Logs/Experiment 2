Experiment 2 : Testing the navigational capabilities of the QTCB calculus in a indoor corridor environment 

Expected Results: 
*Succesful navigation of the corridor while avoiding collision with the walls.
*A highly discontinuous motion profile with jerky motion.
*A video log of the performed experiment.


Experiment Variables:
*Initial position and orientation of the robot.
*Field of View of the camera.
*Lighting conditions of the corridor.
*Initial Position of the camera.
*Position of the markers relative to the fixed camera position.
*Position of the markers relative to each other.
*Battery voltage.
*Range of the wireless network.


Software Requirements:
*ROS Kinetic
*Python 2.7 or higher
*Qsr_lib package
*Qsr_nav package
*Mir_bringup package ?
*Mir_moveit_youbot_brsu_4 package ?
*Moveit_commander package ?


Hardware Requirements:
*Kuka Youbot
*PC capable of runnning ROS
*Remote joystick 
*External power supply 
*Aruco markers
*Asus Xtion Pro camera


Procedure:
*Place the markers on opposite walls of the corridor along a common perpendicular axis.
*Verify that the emergency switch is not activated and the battery is connected to the robot.
*Ensure that the robot is powered on along with the PC and the Motors.
*Login to the robot using ssh.
*Launch the robot.launch file from the mir_bringup package.
*Launch the move_group.launch file from the mir_moveit_youbot_brsu_4 package.
*Run the moveit_commander_cmdline.py script from the moveit_commander package.
*Select arm_1 in the moveit_commander_cmdline.py and bring the arm to the default position using the go candle command.
*Use the joystick to position the camera roughly (R:3.877, P:-4.840, Y:-.202, degrees approximately) parellel to the robot base.
*Use the joystick to bring the robot to the designated starting position of the corridor.
*Launch the qtcb.launch file from the qsr_nav package.
*Record the results and data using rosbag record (and/or a handheld video recorder).
*Repeat the experiment from the opposite end of the corridor.
*Kill all ongoing processes and dock the robot back to its station.


Obtained Results and Analysis:
*When starting from a central postion along the corridor, the robot managed to successfully navigate the corridor.
*The motion profile is smooth and not jerky as previously thought.
*The robot maintains a path that is along the center of the corridor.
*No collision cases were observed.
*It remains crucial to the algorithm that atleast two markers are detected simultaneously, when placed along the same axis.
