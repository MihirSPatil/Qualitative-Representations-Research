\chapter{Approach}
The conclusions drawn in the previous chapter, allow us the liberty of focusing specifically on the two most promising qualitative calculi $QTC_B$ and $ARGD$, for the purpose of developing an algorithm that centers around the utilization of either one or both of these calculi for the purpose of qualitatively representing physical space in our application of mobile robot navigation.
